## About IdentityServer4

IdentityServer is a free, open source [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/) and [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) framework for ASP.NET Core.
Founded ~~and maintained~~ by [Dominick Baier](https://twitter.com/leastprivilege) and [Brock Allen](https://twitter.com/brocklallen), IdentityServer4 incorporates all the protocol implementations and extensibility points needed to integrate token-based authentication, single-sign-on and API access control in your applications.
IdentityServer4 was officially [certified](https://openid.net/certification/) by the [OpenID Foundation](https://openid.net) and thus spec-compliant and interoperable.
It was part of the [.NET Foundation](https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/), and operates under their [code of conduct](https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct). It is licensed under [Apache 2](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) (an OSI approved license).
